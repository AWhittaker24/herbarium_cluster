# Herbarium Specimen Clustering
This project is to identify which herbarium specimen records are able to be linked by comparing the duplicate codes listed in the specimens examined supplementary material of a taxonomic revision and those linked through [GBIF’s Related Records function](https://www.gbif.org/news/4U1dz8LygQvqIywiRIRpAU/new-data-clustering-feature-aims-to-improve-data-quality-and-reveal-cross-dataset-connections). This is with the aim to outline the limitations of linking herbarium specimens and identifying the distribution of herbarium specimen records.
## Background
Herbarium specimens are preserved plant specimens with associated collection data. This collection data typically includes the plant specimen’s taxonomic name, who collected the specimen, its collection number, geographical location and date of collection.
Botanists collect multiple herbarium specimens, also known as duplicates, from the same (or surrounding) individuals. These duplicate herbarium specimens are legally required to be distributed to other herbaria (Nagoya Protocol) but historically have been distributed to secure the preservation of the specimen and its data, and to expand other herbarium collections (Davies *et al.*, 2013).
#### Why should herbarium specimens be linked?
Natural history collections are becoming more digitally available via data aggregators such as GBIF, however the disparity in funding and priority across institutions has resulted in collections having varying levels of data associated with an individual specimen record. Currently checking for a duplicate record is a lengthy process, so having duplicate specimen records with their varying levels of data linked will facilitate curation and research. From this it will become clear as to what, as a community, we should prioritise future effort and collaboration.
